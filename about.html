        <h1>About Baseball Analytica</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Baseball Analytica has been Addison Kline's personal baseball and sabermetrics blog since 2021. Originally conceived in early January of that year, Kline wanted to create a platform to express his opinions and detail his statistical ideas regarding America's pastime. He had been very interested in baseball since a young age, but reading the legendary Moneyball by Michael Lewis led him into the world of sabermetrics. He began creating formulas to better evaluate players in the Notes app of his phone, and fed spreadsheets of data into these statistics to test them. After spending much of quarantine scouring the internet for all kinds of baseball data and making note of his findings, Kline wanted to give himself a voice in the baseball world.<br> <br> The site was built from scratch using some relatively simple HTML and CSS in the span of about two months. Kline began writing his first posts on Baseball Analytica in March 2021. Of course, the site is still young, so there is currently not much here, but expect a great many more posts to come!<br> <br> The primary font used on this site is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro?preview.text_type=custom" target="_blank">Source Code Pro</a> by <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/designers/paul-d-hunt" target="_blank">Paul D. Hunt</a>. All formulas are written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)#Courier_New" target="_blank">Courier New</a>, including those in the banner. The Baseball Analytica logo and banner were both designed by Addison Kline himself. Formulas on the banner are those listed from a variety of sources, including <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/" target="_blank">Baseball Reference</a> and <a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/" target="_blank">Fangraphs</a>. <br> <br> *Not affiliated with <a href="http://baseball-analytica.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">this site</a>, also called Baseball Analytica.*</p>
