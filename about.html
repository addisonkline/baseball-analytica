        <h1>About Baseball Analytica</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Founded in 2021 as <a href="/writers/kline">Addison Kline</a>'s personal baseball blog, Baseball Analytica has since become an internet hot spot for sabermetrics discussion and innovation. Since its inception, it has expanded in both size and scope, now having multiple writers as well as fully-fledged ranking and projection systems.<br> <br> Originally conceived in early January of that year, Kline wanted to create a platform to express his opinions and detail his statistical ideas regarding America's pastime. He had been very interested in baseball since a young age, but reading the legendary Moneyball by Michael Lewis led him into the world of sabermetrics. He began creating formulas to better evaluate players in the Notes app of his phone, and fed spreadsheets of data into these statistics to test them. After spending much of quarantine scouring the internet for all kinds of baseball data and making note of his findings, Kline wanted to give himself a voice in the baseball world. The site was built from scratch using some relatively simple HTML and CSS in the span of about two months—giving the site its iconic sleek yet bare-bones look it still has today. In March, work on the first posts began, and by May, the site was up and running. Soon after, the site's first power rankings were published, marking the beginning of an iconic bi-seasonal tradition.<br> <br> In 2022, a second writer, <a href="/writers/carreno">Albert Carreno</a>, joined the site. Growing up, Carreno's favorite sport was baseball. He played through high school primarily as a pitcher and was an avid Yankees fan. In addition, he enjoyed working with numbers and had a knack for math, making his entrance into the sabermetrics world just about inevitable (like Kline, he considers reading Moneyball to be a key part in his discovery of the field). He is now committed to improving the average fan's understanding of baseball's nuts and bolts through statistics and to help make important discoveries along the way that further help this burgeoning field.<br> <br> Most recently, a set of daily in-season projections was created, known as the Family of Optimized Expectations for the Year, or FOXY for short. Note that this site is a perpetual work-in-progress, regularly expanding and improving—so be sure to stay tuned!<br> <br> </p>
