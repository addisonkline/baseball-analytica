## Written Description

Baseball Analytica is a blog dedicated to baseball and sabermetrics built using relatively simple HTML and CSS. It consists of a Posts page (the de facto home page), an About page, and a Contact page.

If you are here, you likely came from the Baseball Analytica website through the GitHub repository link in the About section. Since the bulk of this site is completed (as of my writing), expect the vast majority of new updates to this repository to be new posts.
